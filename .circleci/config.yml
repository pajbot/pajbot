# CircleCI configuration
# see: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/

# The "setup" job clones pajbot and initializes the virtual environment and then saves
# the entire working directory to the cache.
# The "test" and "lint" jobs then fan out in parallel, restore the cache that "setup" produced
# (using the load_setup command defined below) and run their respective command.
